# My master thesis
Android Application that uses Convolutional neural network trained by custom dataset, to do real time inference and detects traffic signs near the road.
When running on PC, inference of model is very slow, because it is optimized for ARM architecture used by mobile phones.
<br></br>
In real world testing, application was able to detect road signs about 10 meters from car at 50 km/h, making it particulary useful as a reminder of what were last few signs that driver passed by.
Besides application, there is full word file documenting all design decisions, data gathering, data improvement, model training and testing, as well as full dataset used to train said model.
